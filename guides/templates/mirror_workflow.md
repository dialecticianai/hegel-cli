## File Operations

**CRITICAL**: Write your document to a file, don't paste in chat.

1. **Write to the appropriate file** using the Write tool (location depends on mode)
2. **Use checkboxes** in Success Criteria sections for tracking progress
3. **Launch review**: Run `hegel reflect <filename>` to open GUI for user review
4. **Read feedback**: Check `.ddd/<name>.review.*` files if user adds comments
5. **Incorporate feedback**: Update document based on review before proceeding

The review GUI allows the user to select text and add inline comments.
