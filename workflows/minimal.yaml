# Minimal workflow for testing (2 nodes, 1 transition)
mode: discovery
start_node: spec

nodes:
  spec:
    summary: Define inputs, outputs, and invariants in a specification document.
    prompt: "Write a SPEC.md defining inputs, outputs, and invariants."
    transitions:
      - when: "spec_complete"
        to: plan

  plan:
    summary: Write an implementation plan with testable steps.
    prompt: "Write a PLAN.md with testable steps."
    transitions:
