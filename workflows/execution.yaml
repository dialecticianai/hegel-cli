      {{SPEC_WRITING}}

      Your task: Create a lean, focused behavioral contract through collaborative discovery.
      {{?context_note}}

      Execution mode focus:
      - Clear, minimal contracts that define core behavior
      - Happy path and essential error cases only
      - Test scenarios that drive TDD, not exhaustive edge case coverage
      - Simple acceptance criteria focused on working functionality
      - Keep it agile: specs should enable forward motion, not defensive programming

      **CRITICAL - Follow this sequence:**

      1. **Discovery Phase - Orient from documentation, then code**:
         - Read project documentation for architecture, conventions, patterns, testing infrastructure
         - Read existing code for related functionality, types, and APIs
         - Verify what dependencies already provide (don't reinvent)
         - Understand module boundaries and type placement
         - Document findings: what exists, what needs changing, what's missing

      2. **Discuss before writing**:
         - Use the SPEC_WRITING guide above to inform what questions to ask
         - Clarify constraints: Breaking vs. backward compatible? MVP vs. production-ready?
         - Clarify scope: Lean first pass? What's explicitly out of scope?
         - Validate architectural understanding: Are module boundaries correct?
         - Focus on WHAT needs to work, not every edge case that could break
         - Confirm type structures make sense (no redundancy, clean separation)
         - Gather missing context for a minimal viable spec

      3. **Write the spec**:
         - Only after discussion is complete, draft the SPEC.md
         - Reference actual file paths and existing types explicitly
         - Specify NEW vs. MODIFIED vs. REMOVED clearly
         - Mark uncertainties as "(TBD: verify)" rather than speculating
         - Keep it lean: core behavior, key scenarios, working functionality
         - Defer edge cases, performance tuning, advanced features to "Out of Scope"
         - Avoid over-engineering: no security hardening, no premature optimization
         - **CRITICAL: No implementation samples** - describe behavior in prose, not code snippets
         - Success criteria must be agent-verifiable (tests pass, builds succeed, schemas match)
         - Separate subjective concerns into "Optional Human Testing" section
         - Incorporate insights from codebase review and user discussion
         - Respond with your completed SPEC.md content

      The guide is there to shape your questions, not to bypass discussion.
      Remember: Execution mode is agile and TDD-focused, not production-hardening.

      - when: "spec_complete"
        to: plan

  plan:
    prompt: |
      You are in the PLAN phase of Document-Driven Development (Execution Mode).

      {{PLAN_WRITING}}

      Your task: Create a lean, TDD-focused implementation plan.
      {{?context_note}}

      Execution mode approach:
      - TDD where it drives development forward (not for coverage metrics)
      - Core functionality first, edge cases only when essential
      - Integration points identified, not over-tested
      - Keep it agile: working code over defensive programming
      - Tests serve development, not audit requirements

      **Commit Planning:**
      - Identify logical commit boundaries as you write steps
      - Group trivial steps (dependencies, scaffolding, helpers) into single commits
      - Separate substantial implementation (features, integrations, major refactors) into their own commits
      - Mark commit boundaries explicitly in the plan with "Commit Point" markers

      Remember: This plan covers implementation only. Do not include manual testing or documentation update steps - those happen in later workflow phases.

      Respond with your completed PLAN.md content.

      Implement the system following the PLAN.md steps.
      {{?context_note}}

      Execution mode approach:
      - Tests that drive development, not exhaustive coverage
      - Error handling for real failure scenarios, not hypothetical ones
      - Working functionality over defensive programming
      - Clear code over premature optimization
      - Simple and direct over clever and general

      Respond when code is complete and all tests pass.

      {{CODE_MAP_WRITING}}

      Your task: Update README code maps for areas touched during implementation.
      {{?context_note}}

      Focus on:
      - Identify which directories were modified during CODE phase
      - Update README files with code map changes for those directories
      - In monolithic mode: Update the Code Structure section in root README.md
      - In hierarchical mode: Update or create README.md files for modified directories
      - Ensure descriptions accurately reflect current code structure
      - Keep descriptions concise (1-3 sentences per file)
      - Follow the code_map_style configured for this project

      Respond when README code map updates are complete.
    transitions:
      - when: "code_review_complete"
        to: readme

  readme:
    prompt: |
      You are in the README phase of Document-Driven Development (Execution Mode).

      **CRITICAL - Project-Level README Update Protocol:**

      1. **Read the WHOLE existing README.md first** (root-level project README)
         - Understand current structure, sections, and organization
         - Note the existing writing style, tone, and formatting conventions
         - Identify code map sections (monolithic or hierarchical)
         - Find where the new feature naturally fits

      2. **Match existing style and structure**
         - Follow established patterns for headings, code blocks, examples
         - Maintain consistency with existing section depth and organization
         - Preserve any existing navigation or cross-references
         - Keep the same voice and level of detail

      3. **Update appropriate sections to document the new feature**
         - Add feature to relevant sections (don't create duplicate structure)
         - Update code structure/architecture sections if needed
         - Add usage examples that match existing example style
         - Update table of contents or navigation if present

      4. **Focus on integration, not wholesale rewrite**
         - Minimal changes to accomplish documentation goal
         - Preserve existing content that remains accurate
         - Only modify sections directly related to the new feature

      {{README_WRITING}}

      Your task: Update the root README.md to document the implemented feature.

      Typical areas to update (if they exist):
      - System overview (mention new capability)
      - Installation/setup (if changed)
      - API documentation (new commands, options, or interfaces)
      - Usage examples (demonstrate new feature)
      - Code structure section (new files or modules)
      - Integration points (if new integrations added)

      Respond when the README.md has been updated.
