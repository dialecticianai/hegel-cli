# Hegel CLI Roadmap

**Vision**: Make Hegel the orchestration layer for Dialectic-Driven Development, integrating seamlessly with Claude Code to enforce methodology through deterministic guardrails and workflow automation.

> **Note for AI assistants**: This roadmap is **future-only**. When a phase is completed, remove it from this document entirely. Do not mark phases as complete - delete them. The roadmap should only show what's coming next.

## Guiding Principles

1. **CLI-first**: Everything works in the terminal
2. **Local-first**: State lives in files, no cloud dependencies
3. **Transparent**: No black boxes, all rules/state inspectable
4. **Deterministic**: Guardrails based on logic, not LLM calls
5. **Composable**: Hegel orchestrates, Claude Code executes
6. **Open source**: Free forever, community-driven

---

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: CLI installs, active workflows started
- **Enforcement**: Interrupt triggers (are guardrails helping?)
- **Velocity**: Features shipped faster with DDD methodology
- **Quality**: Fewer bugs, better architecture (via mandatory refactoring)

---

## Non-Goals

- ❌ Become an IDE (stay CLI-focused)
- ❌ Replace Claude Code (we're the orchestration layer)
- ❌ Require external dependencies (fully local)
- ❌ Hide complexity (make state and rules legible)
